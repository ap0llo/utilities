# ArrayExtensions.GetSegments Method

**Declaring Type:** [ArrayExtensions](../index.md)  
**Namespace:** [Grynwald.Utilities](../../index.md)  
**Assembly:** Grynwald.Utilities

Divides the array into multiple segments with at most `maxSegmentSize` elements in each segment.

```csharp
public static IEnumerable<ArraySegment<T>> GetSegments<T>(this T[] array, int maxSegmentSize);
```

## Type Parameters

`T`

## Parameters

`array`  T\[\]

The array to split into segments.

`maxSegmentSize`  int

The maximum number of elements allowed in a single segment.

## Remarks

`GetSegments` divides the array into segments with at most `maxSegmentSize` elements in each segment.

- If `maxSegmentSize` is greater than the array's size, a single segment is returned.
- If the array's size is a multiple of `maxSegmentSize` each segment will have the same number of elements.
- Otherwise, the last segment will contain fewer elements.

This method is implemented using deferred execution. The segments are not created until the return value is enumerated.

## Returns

IEnumerable\<ArraySegment\<T\>\>

Returns an enumerable of (non\-overlapping) ArraySegment\<T\> structures each representing a section of the underlying array.
