# Versioning and Branching

The version of the library is automatically derived from git and the information
in `version.json` using [Nerdbank.GitVersioning](https://github.com/AArnott/Nerdbank.GitVersioning):

- The master branch  always contains the latest version. Packages produced from
  master are always marked as pre-release versions (using the `-pre` suffix).
- Stable versions are built from release branches. Build from release branches
  will have no `-pre` suffix
- Builds from any other branch will have both the `-prerelease` and the git
  commit hash included in the version string

The `Set-Version.ps1` script from the `scripts` folder can be used to create a new
release branch and update the version on *master*.  The script will:

- read `version.json` to determine the current version of the branch
  (typically *master*)
- create a new release branch for version, e.g. *release/v1.0*
- Remove the pre-release tag from `version.json` on the release branch
- Increment the version on *master* so builds from that branch will produce
  pre-release packages for the next version. The next version is either the 
  next major or minor version, depending on the parameters passed to 
  `Set-Version.ps1` (either `-Major` or `-Minor`)
