feat(configuration): Add support for arrays and enumerables to object configuration provider

Add support for IEnumerables and arrays of supported types to ConfigurationBuilderExtensions.AddObject().
Properties of collection types are mapped to multiple entries in the configuration system and will use the ":x" suffix as settings key.

For example, a property of type 'string[]' with two elements and a "ConfigurationValue" attribute specifying a key of "setting1" will be mapped to two configuration values: "setting1:0" and "setting1:1"
